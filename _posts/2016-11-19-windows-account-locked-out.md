## Issue
I changed my password for the Windows account I used to access shared folders, then I get this error when I access to some folders:
```
The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on...
```

## Solution
Try to add a new mapped drive and check the use another account checkbox, then login with the new credentials.
