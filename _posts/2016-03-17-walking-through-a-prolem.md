title: walking through the problem
---

1. **Listen carefully**: make sure you hear the problem correctly, ask questions about anything yhou're unsure about. mentally **recorded any unique information** in the probleml, write down if necessary;
2. **Draw an example**: the example should not be too simple, **validate the solution** using example and check boundary vlaue**
3. **state brute force** explain what the space and time complexity then drive into imporvents
4. **Optimize** look at unused info? use a fresh example? __BUD__: **B**ottlenecks, **U**nnecessary work, **D**uplicated work. 
5. **Walk through** after you've nailed down an optimal algorithm, dont just dive into coding, take a moment to solidify your understanding of the algorithm.
6. **code**
7. **test**
