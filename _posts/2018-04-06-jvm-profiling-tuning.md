## How to find a Java Memory Leak

```
 - Start the application and wait until it get to "stable" state, when all the initialization is complete and the application is idle.
 - Run the operation suspected of producing a memory leak several times to allow any cache, DB-related initialization to take place.
 - Run GC and take memory snapshot.
 - Run the operation again. Depending on the complexity of operation and sizes of data that is processed operation may need to be run several to many times.
 - Run GC and take memory snapshot.
 - Run a diff for 2 snapshots and analyze it.
