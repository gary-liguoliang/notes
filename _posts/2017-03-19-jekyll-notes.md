## Comment with Disqus

updated `_config.yml` with: 

```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: <short-name>
```
**issue with the default theme(Minima): We were unable to load Disqus.**
however it seems that the code in [default jekyll theme minima/disqus_comments.html](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_includes/disqus_comments.html) is outdated according to code in Disqus. 

**solution: **

created [_includes/disqus_comments.html](https://github.com/guoliang-dev/guoliang-dev.github.io/blob/master/_includes/disqus_comments.html) with the latest code from Disque. 

## Google analytics 

updted `_config.yml` with:

```yaml
google_analytics: <UA-CODE>
```
