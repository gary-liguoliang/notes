title: how to fix&#58;	 BBC podcasts unavailable on iPhone 'Podcasts'
---

## issue
 - all podcasts from BBC were 'unavailable' on my `Podcasts`(iOS 10). other podcasts worked fine. 
 - I cannot play videos / download podcasts from bbc website from my PC.

## solution
from the behavior, I would say it should be caused by my network. 
I'm using the 1 Gbps plan from [myrepublic](https://myaccount.myrepublic.com.sg/), myreplublic has a VPN-like feature called ['Teleport'](https://www.facebook.com/MyRepublicSG/posts/628407610519922).
this could casue my connection issue to BBC. 

the solution is changing the DNS for your router or your deivce. e.g. [Google public dns: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/)
